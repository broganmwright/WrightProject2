Skeleton survival game demo

This is a demo of a skeleton survival game. The game features a third-person view that follows the fully animated player, and includes multiple enemies that roam around
a town environment with trees, fences, and houses. Some decorations around the environment are imported assets, alongside the player/enemy characters. The player can roam
the map and kill the enemies by attacking with left click, and you can pause the game with space and clicking exit.
